          <h3>Software Developer & Web Designer</h3>
          <p>I started showing interest in Software Development and Web Designing when I learnt that they design and write the code used to build everything from operating systems to apps to video games. Over time, I gained lots knowledge in coding in school and college. I started working as a developer in big MNC's</p>

          <h3>PC Games</h3>
          <p>I started playing PC games at a very young age, again thanks to my brother. He got a PC as a present from my father. Since then while he started play games, I played along with him. My first favourite game is the GTA series and loved all those mini flash games which we had in the late 2000s. Currently play AC Vahella</p>
